# Pac-Man Game

This game is a simple version of Pac-Man. To start the game, press 'enter'. The goal of the game is to eat all of the dots on the screen. The user can control Pac-man's movement using the arrow keys (left, right, up, down). There are pre-set walls on the screen that limit where Pac-Man can go. A single key press (left, right, up, or down) will move Pac-Man in that direction (so the user does not need to hold the key down). Pac-Man makes his famous sound when he moves around the screen. The dots laid out over the screen will disappear when Pac-Man eats them. Points (which correspond to the number of dots eaten) are displayed on the top of the screen. The game will end when all of dots are eaten. To pause the game, press ‘P’. To quit the game, press ‘esc'. How fast can you eat all of the dots?
